Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We were able to successfully implement on the changes that we talked about in our proposal. When a ball hits the paddle, the background color changes to a random color. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We are still working on changing the speed when a point is scored. Changing the speed will make the game become harder and harder. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One of the group member has not been partaking in any enhancements to our code. Hopefully she will contribute more or else I will have to report this to Professor Rosen.
