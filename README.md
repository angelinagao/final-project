***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We were able to successfully implement on the changes that we talked about in our proposal. When a ball hits the paddle, the background color changes to a random color. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We are still working on changing the speed when a point is scored. Changing the speed will make the game become harder and harder. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One of the group member has not been partaking in any enhancements to our code. Hopefully she will contribute more or else I will have to report this to Professor Rosen. 

# final-project
# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

#Mario game, a verison of flappy bird, a version of temple run 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

#Elva Li and Haley Mandell 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

#No 




# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
#Pong 2.0 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
#A program that lets you play Pong but with a twist. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
#Our software will preform the game of pong with some new feautres added to it. It will have different features such as hitting a certain spot on the paddle will result in the game speeding up, along with everytime the game speeds up the colors will change. We will execute the game using the server love.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
#Not applicable to our group 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and Tamara Katicand the names of their assigned TAs below.
#Elva Li, tuk84696@temple.edu, with TA Tamara Katic
#Haley Mandell, tum98602@temple.edu, with TA Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
#A good outcome would be that we will successfully accomplish coding the game and it runs successsfully. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
#A better outcome for our final project would be if we can successfully accomplish the coding of the game and implement one the changes that we are thinking about changing for the game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
#The best outcome for your final project would be to successfully be able to code and implement both the changes we want to do to the game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
#Through this project, we will acquire the ability to code with the love server as well as program something that involves graphics and movement. We will need to research the details of how to implement and any special functions in love as well as do a little research on the original game Pong as well. Since we are working in a group of 3, Elva will be looking into how to use Love and Haley and Angelina will research how to code Pong and as a team we will look at how to add the implementations into the game.
